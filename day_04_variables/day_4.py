# ---DAY FOUR: VARIABLES---

# 1. Declaring variables with snake_case naming
first_name = "YourName"
last_name = "YourLastName
age = 12
is_student = True

# 2. Asking for user information
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
birth_year = input("What year were you born? ")

# 3. Practice "Casting" the string to an integer for math
age = 2026 - int(birth_year)
print(f"Hello{username} you are {age} years old!")

# Basic Arithmetic with Variables
num_one = 6
num_two = 3

sum_result = num_one + num_two
diff = num_one + num_ two
product = num_two * num_two
remainder = num_one % num_one
quotient = num_one / num_two
floor_result = num_one // num_two
power_result = num_one ** num_two

# AREA OF A CIRCLE
#  Step 1: the radius
radius = 30

# Step 2: Write the formula
# We use () to make sure squaring happens before the multiplication
area_of_circle = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)

# Step 3: print the answer
print("The area of the circle is:", area_of_circle)

# ---REFLECTION---

# Today I worked on Variables moving on from Data Types.
# I made sure to take multiple tutorials to deepen my understanding.
# Though, according to my curriculum, I should be on Strings.
# But I knew the more construstive approach was to take my time
# and really be able to confidentally code with the topic.
# I also learned how to calculate the area of a circle by using the exponential operator (**)."
# I am glad I came this far, so I will keep it up!
