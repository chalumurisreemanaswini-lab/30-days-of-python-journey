# ---DAY TWO: THE DATA BOXES---
# (continued)

# 1. List (list) - Lists are ordered and you can change them. They use square brackets []
# A list of my favourite food
Food = ["Pasta", "tacos", "wraps"]

# 2. Tuple - Tuples are like lists, but you cannot change them once they are made. They use parentheses
# Constants that shouldn't change, like a birthday
birthday = (1, "January", 2014)

# 3. Set (set) -  Sets have no order and no duplicates. They use curly brackets {}
unique_topics = {"Data Types", "Variables", "Python", "Python"}

# The difference between a List and a Set
example_list = ["apple", "apple", "cherry"]
example_set = {"apple", "apple", "cherry"}

print("List allows duplicates:", example_list)
print("Set removes duplicates:", example_set)

#---REFLECTION---

# I learned more data boxes adding on to the previous data boxes I have learned yesterday. 
# My progress really lets me appreciate how much just little steps make a big difference.
# I realised it all about consistency and moving at your own pace.
# I remember on day 1, how it took so long to understand and work the controls.
# A little research I did, I was wondering what sets could prove useful for.
#Attendance Tracker: Maintain a set of students who attended a class. Use .add() to record names;
# since it’s a set, students won't be counted twice even if you add them again.
# So that is a cool way to use the tool!
